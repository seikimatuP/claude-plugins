### Via Skills.sh (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

```bash
npx skills add hiroro-work/claude-plugins
```

Available skills: `ask-claude`, `ask-codex`, `ask-gemini`, `ask-copilot`, `ask-agy`, `ask-peer`, `security-scanner`, `extract-rules`, `merge-rules`

## Requirements

- **ask-claude**: Requires `claude` CLI
- **ask-codex**: Requires `codex` CLI
- **ask-gemini**: Requires `gemini` CLI
- **ask-copilot**: Requires `copilot` CLI
- **ask-agy**: Requires `agy` CLI
- **peer**: No external dependencies (runs as Claude subagent)
- **translate**: No external dependencies (runs as Claude subagent)
- **security-scanner**: No external dependencies
- **extract-rules**: No external dependencies
- **merge-rules**: No external dependencies (requires extract-rules output from multiple projects)
- **caffeinate**: macOS only (`caffeinate` command)

## Usage

### Skill Plugins (ask-claude, ask-codex, ask-gemini, ask-copilot, ask-agy)

These plugins provide `/ask-*` commands for getting second opinions from other AI assistants.

### Skill Plugin (peer)

Invoke with `/ask-peer` command. Spawns a peer engineer subagent for:

- Planning review before implementation
- Code review after completing work
- Brainstorming for problem-solving
- A second opinion on your approach

### Plugin (caffeinate)

Prevent macOS system sleep during long-running sessions using `caffeinate`.

```bash
/caffeinate            # Start caffeinate
/caffeinate stop       # Stop caffeinate
/caffeinate status     # Check status
```

Automatically stops on session end via SessionEnd hook.

### Skill Plugin (extract-rules)

Extract project-specific coding rules and domain knowledge from your codebase, generating structured markdown documentation for AI agents.

```bash
/extract-rules                      # Extract rules from codebase (initial)
/extract-rules --update             # Re-scan and add new patterns (preserve existing)
/extract-rules --restructure        # Re-analyze, reorganize structure, merge existing rules
/extract-rules --from-conversation  # Extract rules from conversation
```

Output files are generated in `.claude/rules/` directory.

**Configuration** (optional): Create `.claude/extract-rules.local.md` with YAML frontmatter to customize target directories, exclusions, output language, and split output mode. See SKILL.md for details.

### Skill Plugin (merge-rules)

Merge extract-rules output from multiple projects into a unified portable rule set. Promotes `.local.md` patterns shared across projects.

```bash
/merge-rules                    # Merge using config file
/merge-rules --config <path>    # Merge using specified config file
/merge-rules --dry-run          # Show what would be merged without writing
```

**Configuration** (required): Create `.claude/merge-rules.local.md` with YAML frontmatter listing source projects. See SKILL.md for details.
