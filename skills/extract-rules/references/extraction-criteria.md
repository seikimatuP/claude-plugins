# Extraction Criteria

Reference guide for determining what to extract and how to classify patterns.

## Core Principle: Claude's Knowledge Gap

The purpose of rule extraction is to capture what Claude would get wrong or produce differently without seeing this specific codebase. Claude already has extensive knowledge of languages, frameworks, and general best practices. Rules should fill the gap between Claude's general knowledge and this project/team's actual conventions.

## Principle Extraction Criteria

**Goal:** Extract principles where Claude's default behavior would produce code inconsistent with this project's conventions.

### Extract these principles

Principles where **Claude would produce something different** without being told:

- **FP only (classes prohibited)** - Claude might use classes since both paradigms are valid; this team chose one
- **Zustand only (Redux prohibited)** - Claude might suggest Redux as it's more widely documented
- **No ORM, raw SQL only** - Claude would default to ORM as the standard approach
- **Barrel exports required** - Claude might not add index.ts re-exports unless told
- **Anti-patterns the team has deliberately rejected** - Things Claude would naturally do that this team avoids (e.g., "No utility file creation — add to existing modules" / "No default exports — named exports only")

### Do NOT extract these

Principles that **Claude already knows and would follow by default**:

- Language/framework best practices documented in official style guides
- Common code review feedback applicable to any project (const over let, no magic numbers, DRY, SOLID, early returns, etc.)
- Patterns where only one practical approach exists (PascalCase for React components, snake_case for Python, etc.)

**Rule of thumb:** If Claude would produce correct, consistent code without this rule, it is general knowledge — do not extract it.

### Decision criterion

> "Would Claude produce code that is different from this project's conventions without knowing this rule?"
> - **Yes** → Extract it (e.g., Claude would use classes, but this team uses FP only)
> - **No** → Skip it (e.g., Claude already uses const over let, avoids magic numbers)

## Concrete Example Criteria

**Goal:** Determine when to include concrete code examples vs abstract principles.

### Include concrete examples when

Pattern involves **project-defined symbols** that AI cannot infer, **AND** meets at least one scope criterion:

**Symbol criteria** (what):
- **Custom types/interfaces** defined in the project (not from node_modules)
- **Project-specific hooks** (e.g., `useAuthClient`, `useDataFetch`)
- **Utility functions** with non-obvious signatures
- **Non-obvious combinations** (e.g., `pathFor()` + `url()` must be used together)

**Scope criteria** (why it matters):
- **Project-wide usage**: Used across many files/modules, AI needs to know about it to write consistent code
- **Convention-defining**: Not using it would break project consistency (e.g., required wrapper, mandatory type)

**Important: Keep examples minimal**
- One line per pattern: `signature` - context (2-5 words)
- Include only the type signature or function signature
- Omit implementation details, only show the "shape" AI needs to know

### Keep abstract (principles only) when

Pattern uses only **language built-ins** or **well-known patterns**:

- `const`, `let`, spread operators, map/filter/reduce
- Standard design patterns with well-known implementations
- Framework APIs documented in official docs

### Decision criterion

> "Would AI writing **new code** in this project produce **inconsistent results** without knowing this pattern?"
> - **Yes** → Include concrete example (e.g., `useAuth()` — without it, AI would write custom auth logic)
> - **No** → Skip or abstract principle only (e.g., a utility hook used in 2 files — AI not knowing it won't cause inconsistency)

### Example classification

| Pattern | Classification | Reason |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Prefer `const` over `let` | Do not extract | General best practice, AI already knows |
| No magic numbers | Do not extract | General best practice, AI already knows |
| FP only, no classes | Principle | Team-specific paradigm choice |
| `RefOrNull<T>` type usage | Concrete example | Project-defined type, AI cannot infer |
| `pathFor()` + `url()` combination | Concrete example | Project-specific API combination |

### Gray zone handling

For patterns that are **not clearly general or project-specific**:

- Extended types from node_modules (e.g., `type MyUser = User & { custom: string }`)
- Specific combinations of standard libraries (e.g., zod + react-hook-form patterns)

**Fallback rule: When uncertain, apply the scope criterion.**

- If the pattern is used project-wide or defines a convention → include
- If the pattern is a local utility (1-2 usage sites) → skip
- Rationale: Over-specifying with local utilities clutters rule files with implementation details rather than style guidance. Rules should answer "how to write new code" not "what utilities exist."

## Example Quality Criteria

**Goal:** Ensure `.examples.md` files contain useful, accurate examples that help Claude apply rules correctly.

### Good examples (what to include)

- **Source from actual codebase**: Good examples must come from real code found in the project, not fabricated. If no relevant code can be found (e.g., the rule is about something not yet implemented), skip the example for now
- **Minimal but complete**: Show enough context to understand usage, but not full implementation details
- **Representative**: Choose examples that demonstrate the most common usage pattern

### Bad examples (anti-patterns)

- **From actual codebase**: Prefer real anti-patterns found in the project (e.g., older code, refactored patterns)
- **From typical Claude output**: If no real anti-pattern exists, show what Claude would typically generate without the rule
- **Optional**: If no meaningful Bad example exists (e.g., project-specific type usage), omit Bad and show only Good

### When Good/Bad contrast is effective

| Rule type | Good/Bad contrast? | Reason |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Paradigm choices (FP only, no ORM) | Yes | Claude would default to the opposite |
| Prohibited patterns (no default exports) | Yes | Shows what to avoid |
| Project-defined types/hooks | Good only | No meaningful "bad" — Claude just doesn't know the type exists |
| API combinations (pathFor + url) | Good only | Shows correct usage pattern |
