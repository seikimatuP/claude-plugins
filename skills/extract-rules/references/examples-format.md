# Examples File Format (.examples.md)

Reference guide for generating and updating `.examples.md` files.

## Purpose

`.examples.md` files provide Good/Bad code examples that help Claude apply rules correctly. By default they are written to `examples_output_dir` (default: `.claude/rules-extras/`), which sits outside Claude Code's `.claude/rules/**` recursive auto-load scope, so they are NOT auto-loaded into context — Claude reads them only when needed for clarification. When `examples_output_dir` is set to a path under `output_dir`, the resulting `.examples.md` files are auto-loaded along with the rule files. Auto-load behavior is determined by directory placement; the absence of `paths:` frontmatter does not by itself prevent auto-loading.

## File Structure

Always generate one `.examples.md` per rule category (regardless of `split_output` setting). When `split_output: true`, the `.examples.md` combines examples for both `.md` principles and `.local.md` patterns in one file.

**Section headings (`#`, `##`) are always in English regardless of the `language` setting.** Only the rule content (Good/Bad examples, descriptions) follows the `language` setting.

**Example title (`###`) must match the corresponding rule name in the rule file.** Do not translate or rephrase the extracted title. This ensures a clear 1:1 mapping between rules and their examples.

- **Principles**: Use the principle name (text before parenthetical hints)
  - Rule: `- FP only (no classes, pure functions, composition over inheritance)` → `### FP only`
  - Rule: `- Concern分離 (共有ロジックは concerns/ に抽出)` → `### Concern分離`
- **Project-specific patterns**: Use the signature portion (backtick content)
  - Rule: `` - `useAuth() → { user, login, logout }` - auth hook interface `` → `` ### `useAuth() → { user, login, logout }` ``
  - Rule: `` - `clean_bracket_params(:keyword)` - WAF付加のブラケット除去 `` → `` ### `clean_bracket_params(:keyword)` ``

# <Category> Rules - Examples

## Principles Examples

### <Principle name from rule file>
**Good:**
```<lang>
<actual code from codebase demonstrating correct usage>
```
**Bad:**
```<lang>
<anti-pattern found in codebase or typical AI-generated code>
```

## Project-specific Examples

### <Pattern signature from rule file>
```<lang>
<usage example from codebase>
```
```

- No `paths:` frontmatter (kept consistent across modes; auto-load behavior is controlled by `.examples.md`'s placement under `examples_output_dir`, not by frontmatter)
- Skip generating the file if no examples exist for any rule in the category

## Relationship with merge-rules

When merge-rules promotes project-specific patterns to Principles, it converts the pattern format and moves examples to `## Principles Examples`:
- Pattern `` `useAuth() → { user, login, logout }` - auth hook interface `` → Principle `Auth hook interface (useAuth)`
- Pattern example under `## Project-specific Examples` → moved to `## Principles Examples` with the converted principle name as `###` title

After apply-rules applies merged org rules, a project's `.examples.md` may contain both:
- `## Principles Examples` — includes examples for both original principles and promoted patterns
- `## Project-specific Examples` — project-local patterns that were not promoted

apply-rules automatically cleans up duplicates: when a `.local.md` pattern is removed because it matches a promoted Principle, the corresponding `## Project-specific Examples` entry is also removed.

## Good/Bad Contrast Guidelines

- **Principles**: Use Good/Bad contrast. Good examples from actual codebase, Bad from actual anti-patterns or typical Claude-generated code
- **Project-specific patterns**: Good examples only (usage demonstration). Bad is optional

See `extraction-criteria.md` "Example Quality Criteria" section for detailed quality criteria and the decision table for when Good/Bad contrast is effective.

## Reference Section in Rule Files

Each rule file (`.md` and `.local.md`) that has a corresponding `.examples.md` must end with a reference section. The reference path is the **relative path from the rule file's directory to the matching `.examples.md` file under `examples_output_dir`** — compute it against the live `output_dir` and `examples_output_dir` settings:

```markdown
## Examples
When in doubt: <relative-path-to-examples-file>
```

Concrete cases:

- Default settings (`output_dir: .claude/rules`, `examples_output_dir: .claude/rules-extras`):
  - Rule file `.claude/rules/languages/typescript.md` references `../../rules-extras/languages/typescript.examples.md`
  - Rule file `.claude/rules/project.md` references `../rules-extras/project.examples.md`
- Co-located settings (`examples_output_dir` set equal to `output_dir`, e.g. `.claude/rules`):
  - Rule file `.claude/rules/languages/typescript.md` references `./typescript.examples.md`
  - Rule file `.claude/rules/project.md` references `./project.examples.md`

When `examples_output_dir` is changed and `--restructure` regenerates the rule layout, this reference section is rewritten with the new relative path so the link continues to point at the live examples file location. Modes that emit or maintain this reference section (Full Extraction Step 6, Update Step U5, Restructure Step R4, Conversation Step C5, Conversation Candidate Apply Step A2, PR Review Step P5) must use the same relative-path calculation so the format stays consistent across rebuilds.

**Note**: In incremental modes (Conversation Step C5, Conversation Candidate Apply Step A2, PR Review Step P5), staging-only project-level entries (1st-observation candidates written to `<staging_output_dir>/project.staging.local.md` rather than `<output_dir>/project.md`) **skip** the `.examples.md` generation step — the 1st observation's code site is intentionally not anchored to keep `.examples.md` free of 1-shot samples. Examples are generated on promote (2nd observation lands in canonical). See `conversation-mode.md` § Step C5's **"Update `.examples.md`"** step for the canonical statement.

**Direction is one-way: rule file → examples file only.** `.examples.md` files themselves never carry a `## Examples` reference section — no self-reference (link to themselves), no link to a sibling `.examples.md`. When generating or updating an examples file, do not append a reference section. Templates and subagent prompts that scaffold examples files must omit this section.

## Common Generation Procedure

This procedure applies to all modes (Full Extraction, Update, Restructure, Conversation, Conversation Candidate Apply, PR Review). After generation, run the Portability check (below).

### For Full Extraction / Restructure

Examples are generated alongside rule files. Since the codebase has already been analyzed in earlier steps, use the code patterns already collected to create examples.

### For Update / Conversation / Conversation Candidate Apply / PR Review (incremental modes)

For each new rule added:

1. **Search the codebase** (using Grep/Read) to find actual code examples that demonstrate the rule
2. **For principles**: Find Good examples in the codebase; for Bad, look for older/refactored code or use typical Claude output as contrast
3. **For project-specific patterns**: Find actual usage sites in the codebase
4. **If no relevant code can be found** (e.g., the rule is about something not yet implemented): skip the example for now
5. Append to `<examples_output_dir>/<name>.examples.md`. Create the file (and any missing parent directories under `examples_output_dir`) if it doesn't exist

## Portability check (post-generation)

After writing each example + description, re-read the pair and ask: "Does this description hold for every call site of this pattern, or does it leak assumptions from the specific site it was mined from?"

Common leaks:

- **Test-file origin**: unit-test samples often describe the pattern in test-isolation terms. Either rewrite the description in production-contract terms with a production Good example, or add a `test-only` qualifier to the rule title
- **Specific-site framing**: description references local variables / fixture names. Rewrite in terms of the pattern's contract

Applies to all modes (Full Extraction, Update, Restructure, Conversation, Conversation Candidate Apply, PR Review).
