# Dev Workflow

## Usage

```text
/dev-workflow --init         # Project setup (detect lint/format/test commands)
/dev-workflow <task>         # Execute workflow (default)
```

## Prerequisites

- **peer plugin**: Required for plan/code review. If unavailable, ask user directly instead.
- **extract-rules skill**: Required for rule update. If unavailable, skip with message.

## Configuration

Settings file: `dev-workflow.local.md` (YAML frontmatter only)
- Project-level: `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` (takes precedence)
- User-level: `~/.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`

```yaml
---
lint_command: "pnpm run lint:fix"
format_command: "pnpm run format"
test_command: "pnpm run test"
---
```

## Mode Detection

- `--init` → Init Mode
- Otherwise → Execution Mode

---

## Init Mode

1. Detect project type from config files (package.json, Gemfile, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, Makefile)
2. Detect package manager from lock files (JS/TS only)
3. Infer appropriate lint/format/test commands for the detected project type
4. Present detected commands to user for confirmation
5. Save to `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md`

---

## Execution Mode

### Step 1: Load Settings

1. Read `.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` (project-level, priority) or `~/.claude/dev-workflow.local.md` (user-level)
2. If neither exists, prompt user to run `/dev-workflow --init` and stop

### Step 2: Create Plan

1. `EnterPlanMode`
2. Analyze the task and codebase, create implementation plan
3. **No code changes in this phase**

### Step 3: Peer Plan Review (max 3 iterations)

1. `Skill(ask-peer)`: Review the plan. Instruct peer to also read `.claude/rules/` for project conventions.
2. Evaluate feedback, apply improvements, reject inapplicable points
3. Re-review if modified, repeat until no actionable feedback remains
4. If max iterations reached, present to user for decision

### Step 4: Finalize Plan

1. `ExitPlanMode` to begin implementation

### Step 5: Implement

1. Follow the plan, track progress with `TodoWrite`

### Step 6: Simplify

1. `Skill(simplify)`: Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found

### Step 7: Lint / Format / Test (max 3 retries)

1. Run `lint_command`, `format_command`, `test_command` in order (only configured commands)
2. On failure: fix and retry. After 3 retries, report to user and stop
3. **Only execute commands from the configuration file**

### Step 8: Peer Code Review (max 3 iterations)

1. `Skill(ask-peer)`: Review code changes (include `git diff HEAD` to capture all changes since workflow start). Instruct peer to also read `.claude/rules/`.
2. Evaluate feedback, fix genuine issues, reject inapplicable points
3. If code modified, re-run Step 7, then re-review
4. If max iterations reached, present to user for decision

### Step 9: Update Rules

1. `Skill(extract-rules)` with `--from-conversation` (always)
2. `Skill(extract-rules)` with `--update` (only if significant structural/pattern changes occurred)
3. If extract-rules is unavailable, skip this step and inform user

### Completion

Report summary: tasks completed, files modified, test results, review outcomes, rules updated.
